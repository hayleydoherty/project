## Fisher's Iris Data Set

British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher first published his *Iris data set* in 1936 in his paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis[1].  This data set is commonly used in statistics, pattern recognition and visualisation to this day.  The data set consists of 50 samples from 3 species of iris, Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. From each of the 150 samples, 4 measurements were taken which were the length and width of both petal and sepal. A small problem with the dataset is that there is disagreement amongst botanists as to whether the Iris plant has sepals! However this problem has not had an effect on the use of the dataset for statistical purposes as *Web of Science* lists roughly 4000 citations to Fisher's 1939 paper [2].
